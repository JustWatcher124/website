# A Website -- Built in Vite + Reactjs


There is pretty much nothing I want to do on here, I just want to have my own Website.


If you want to look at this website, its available under my domain [jw124.de](https://www.jw124.de) (Yes, I am german)

You can make suggestions if you want to, I may or may not make them.


The Website is hosted on [AWS](https://www.aws.com) needing these services:
- AWS Amplify (For the hosting of the website from this Github Repo)
- AWS Route 53 (For DNS Settings)
- The domain was bought at GoDaddy.com.
